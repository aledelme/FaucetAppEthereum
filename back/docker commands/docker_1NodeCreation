/*
# This command is used to run a Docker container for creating a new Ethereum account.

# `docker run` is the command to start a new container.

# `--rm` option ensures that the container is automatically removed after it exits.

# `-it` option allows you to run the container interactively (i.e., it attaches a terminal to the container).

# `-v ${PWD}/data/keystore:/data` maps the local directory `${PWD}/data/keystore` to `/data` inside the container.
# This ensures that any data written to `/data` inside the container is saved to `${PWD}/data/keystore` on the host.

# `ethereum/client-go:v1.11.5` is the name and version of the Docker image to run. 
# In this case, it's the Ethereum Go client version 1.11.5.

# `account new` is a command to create a new Ethereum account.

# `--keystore data` specifies the directory inside the container where the keystore files for the new account will be saved.
# Since `/data` inside the container is mapped to `${PWD}/data/keystore` on the host, 
# the keystore files will be saved there on the host.
